/loadActors/{actors}
Provides a way to create WorkerActors based on the number of actos specified.
Each actor is calling a BuisnessService to perform a sleep of 1 second
Also the creating of actors is happening in the controller so the call will be blocked for the amount of time
until all the actors complete the perform method.
